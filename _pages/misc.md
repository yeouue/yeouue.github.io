Sharing and communication are important as we all need emotional support, consonance, and discussion to shape and become who we are. Here, I would like to share more about me.


## My Hobbies ##
In my free time, I have a lot of hobbies as my brain food.  


### Language ###
I am a big fan of languages. Culture represents a group of human beings, while language represents a type of culture. Research shows that learning a foreign language is beneficial for mental activities. Getting the hang of a language can help us understand more about our fellow human beings rather than live in a world filled with misunderstandings and biases and explore more amazing things created by us, the little speck in the universe. Language is the key to the door of a new world. 

Here are the languages I can use confidently:
1. [**Mandarin Chinese**](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Mandarin-language): My native language. There are numerous dialects of Chinese, and Mandarin is the standard to make sure people can understand each other. As one of the most complicated and oldest languages due to the fruitful meanings of thousands of characters and various tones, Chinese features powerful rhythm and conciseness, which can be strongly represented through [poetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_poetry).
2. [**English**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language): I started learning English at 7 as it was a mandatory subject in school. I never found it difficult to learn, although I did not fully practice listening and speaking as the English classes in school focused much on reading and writing and English was not a daily need in China. My English skills improved a lot after I moved to the United States where I intentionally force myself to use English every day, such as reading news articles, listening to podcasts, and even talking to strangers whenever appropriate.
3. [**Cantonese Chinese**](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Cantonese-language): I taught myself Cantonese when I was an undergrad out of my affection for pop songs and movies from Hong Kong. Cantonese, as a subsystem of Chinese, uses the same writing system as Mandarin, while its pronunciations are quite different as there are six tones and some unique pronunciations that do not exist in Mandarin. It is influential thanks to its common usage in Guangdong (or Canton, where it gets its name) province, Guangxi province, Hong Kong SAR, Macau SAR, and many Chinese communities overseas. 
4. [**Japanese**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language): It is probably the easiest foreign language for people from East Asia, especially China, as the writing system including Kanji, Hiragana, and Katakana is heavily based on Chinese characters, and the grammar and pronunciations of many vocabularies are similar to Chinese. Learning Japanese helps me better understand my native language from another perspective. 

I am interested in any language worldwide, and I would like to learn as many languages as possible. Here are the languages I am casually learning in my free time:
* **French**: Its rhythm is intriguing!
* **Dutch**: I like biking and windmills!
* **Portuguese**: My advisor is originally from Brazil, a country full of passion for life in my impression! 
* **Spanish**: It is the most used foreign language in America, especially in Florida where I live. 
* **Russian**: It sounds cool!
* **Korean**: I like some Korean TV shows and songs, and there are also a lot of similarities with Chinese.


### Reading ###
I like reading widely and casually while relaxing myself. Although I do not limit the content I read, magic realism and life management are what I read the most. There are numerous great books, so the breadth of reading is more important than depth unless the content is important enough to slow down, think, and take a note. 

Here are some books I would like to recommend (update occasionally):
* [_One Hundred Years of Solitude_](https://www.britannica.com/topic/One-Hundred-Years-of-Solitude) by [Gabriel García Márquez](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/1982/marquez/biographical/)
* [_Cold Mountain_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_Mountain_(novel)) by [Charles Frazier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Frazier)
* [_The Republic_](https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Republic) by [Plato](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato/)
* [_The Social Animal_](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/203968) by [Elliot Aronson](https://aronson.socialpsychology.org/) and [Joshua Aronson](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/people/joshua-aronson)
* [_The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness_](https://www.navalmanack.com/) by [Eric Jorgenson](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4029970.Eric_Jorgenson)

Some of my favorite writers include (update occasionally):

* [Yasunari Kawabata](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/1968/kawabata/biographical/), Japanese novelist and short story writer, 1968 Nobel laureate in literature


### Traveling ###
Reading keeps me in touch with the world, but the best way to know more about the world is to travel, see, communicate, and feel by myself. It could be expensive, but it is worthwhile if applicable. 
Here are some places I have visited and highly recommend (update occasionally):
* [Boston](https://www.meetboston.com/), MA, United States
* [Hongcun](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1002/), Anhui, China
* [Macau](https://www.macaotourism.gov.mo/en/), China
* [Chiang Mai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiang_Mai), Thailand
* [Malacca](https://www.melaka-tourism.com/), Malaysia


### Music ###
Music is the universal language of mankind. I learned keyboard (thus a bit of piano as well) and [erhu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erhu) at a young age. I like classical, pop, indie, and country music. Here are some of my favorite musicians (update occasionally):
* [Frédéric Chopin](https://www.youtube.com/@chopininstitute), Polish composer and virtuoso pianist
* [Lang Lang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0tK9F_6g2w), Chinese pianist
* [Arthur Rubinstein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttLRonyyMak), Polish-American pianist
* [Coldplay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j82L3pLjb_0), British rock band
* [Yao Beina](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8MjP2t1zXw), Chinese singer
* [Sodagreen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuEja-aL1Uk), Taiwanese indie band



### Sports ###
I like various physical sports, such as running, swimming, and playing basketball and table tennis. As for intellectual sports, I like playing [Go](https://www.britannica.com/topic/go-game), one of the oldest and the most complicated board games. You have probably heard of it because of [AlphaGo](https://www.deepmind.com/research/highlighted-research/alphago) developed by Google DeepMind in recent years.  



## My Philosophy ##
My views are heavily influenced by [Daoism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/daoism/), [Chinese Buddism](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/09/21/6-facts-about-buddhism-in-china/), and [Confusianism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Confucianism). Although I have no religious belief as I regard religion as another way to explain and appreciate the world, I am interested in the core ideas of any religion and absorb some of them into my own worldview.

We can neither change the past nor predict the future, because every success requires the satisfaction of multiple conditions, including but not limited to hard work. If we tried our best yet still could not make it, just let it go. The world is full of randomness, so there must be something not for us and something else waiting for us. Even if we were able to accurately predict the future, such as who we would meet, when we would get a new job, and how much money we would make, life would become so boring because it is many surprising teeny-tiny things that make this journey full of excitement. 

We came to the earth, met each other, and created some wonderful memories. Eventually, we will die, the earth will die, and everything will vanish, just like we have never existed. Everything is so unpredictable, thus every second is cherishable, and even some undesirable experiences help us grow up. When I get old and look back on my whole life, what makes me regret would not be what I did but what I never tried. 

In short, life is unpredictable and full of randomness, so I appreciate every second. The only meaning of my life is to experience. Live in the moment.

Just like what unpredictability means, my thoughts will also develop as my life goes on. I like to talk to different people to stay open-minded and absorb new ideas to challenge and refine my existing ideological framework. There are no right or wrong thoughts to me as long as they are within the range of ethics, although the concept of objective justice must exist in the wild to regulate society. 

Here are some related ideas that shaped my views:
