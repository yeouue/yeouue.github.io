In my free time, I have a lot of hobbies as my brain food.

## Language ##
I am a big fan of languages. Culture represents a group of human beings, while language represents a type of culture. Research shows that learning a foreign language is beneficial for mental activities. Getting the hang of a language can help us understand more about our fellow human beings rather than live in a world filled with misunderstandings and biases and explore more amazing things created by us, the little speck in the universe. 

Here are the languages I can basically use:
1. **English**: I started learning English at 7 as it is a mandatory subject in school. I did not find it difficult to learn English grammar and vocabulary, but I did not practice speaking a lot because the class focus in school was focus much on reading and writing. My English ability improved significantly after I moved to the United States, and I am still learning it every day.
2. **Mandarin Chinese**: My native language. As one of the most complicated and oldest languages, I am always fascinated by the beauty and conciseness of the ancient characters and rhythms.
3. **Cantonese Chinese**: I taught myself Cantonese when I was an undergrad due to my affection for pop songs and movies from Hong Kong. Cantonese is widely used in Guangdong (or Canton, which is the origin of its name) province, Hong Kong SAR, and Macau SAR in south China as well as ethnic Chinese communities overseas. It is widely recognized to be closer to ancient Chinese, so the grammar and characters are nearly the same as Mandarin, but the pronunciation is the biggest challenge for non-native speakers as there are six tones and unique pronunciations that do not exist in Mandarin.
4. **Japanese**: It is probably the easiest foreign language for people from East Asia, especially China, as the grammar is very similar to Chinese, and the writing system is heavily based on Chinese characters, including Kanji, Hiragana, and Katakana, and the pronunciation of many vocabularies are similar to Chinese.

I am interested in any language in the world, and I am trying to learn as many languages as possible. Here are some of the languages I am learning in my free time:
* **French**: Its rhythm is intriguing!
* **Dutch**: I like biking!
* **Portuguese**: My advisor is originally from Brazil, a country full of energy and passion in my opinion! 
* **Spanish**: It is the most used foreign language in America, especially in Florida where I live. 
* **Russian**: It sounds cool!
* **Korean**: I like some Korean TV shows and songs, and there are also a lot of similarities with Chinese.

## Reading ##
I like reading widely and casually while relaxing myself. Although I do not limit the content I read, realistic novels and financial management are what I read the most. There are so many great books, so reading greedily and casually is helpful most of the time unless the content is so important that we should slow down, think a bit, and take a note. 

Here are some books I would like to generously recommend (updated occasionally):
* [One Hundred Years of Solitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Hundred_Years_of_Solitude) by [Gabriel García Márquez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Garc%C3%ADa_M%C3%A1rquez)

## Sports ##
I like various physical sports. I like running, swimming, and playing basketball and table tennis. As for intellectual sports, I like playing [Go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y), one of the oldest board games and the most complicated one. You have probably heard of it because of [AlphaGo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y) developed by Google Deepmind several years ago.
