In my free time, I have a lot of hobbies as my brain food.

## Language ##
I am a big fan of languages. Culture represents a group of human beings, while language represents a type of culture. Research shows that learning a foreign language is beneficial for mental activities. Getting the hang of a language can help us understand more about our fellow human beings rather than live in a world filled with misunderstandings and biases and explore more amazing things created by us, the little speck in the universe. Language is the key to the door of a new world. 

Here are the languages I can use confidently:
1. [**Mandarin Chinese**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandarin_Chinese): My native language. As one of the most complicated and oldest languages in the world, I am fascinated by the beauty of its rhythm and conciseness, especially the [poetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_poetry).
2. [**English**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language): I started learning English at 7 as it was a mandatory subject in school I never found it difficult to learn, although I did not practice listening and speaking a lot because the English classes in school focused much on reading and writing and English was not necessary in China. My English skills improved a lot after I moved to the United States as I would intentionally force myself to use it every day, such as reading news articles and talking to strangers whenever appropriate.
3. [**Cantonese Chinese**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantonese): I taught myself Cantonese when I was an undergrad due to my affection for pop songs and movies from Hong Kong. It is widely used in Guangdong (or Canton, where it gets its name) province, Guangxi province, Hong Kong SAR, Macau SAR, and many Chinese communities overseas. It is relatively closer to ancient Chinese, so the grammar and characters are nearly the same as Mandarin, yet the pronunciation is the biggest challenge for non-native speakers as there are six tones and some unique pronunciations that do not exist in Mandarin.
4. [**Japanese**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language): It is probably the easiest foreign language for people from East Asia, especially China, as the grammar is very similar to Chinese, and the writing system including Kanji, Hiragana, and Katakana is heavily based on Chinese characters, and the pronunciation of many vocabularies are similar to Chinese. Learning Japanese helps me better understand my native language from another perspective. 

I am interested in any language worldwide, and I am trying to learn as many languages as possible. Here are the languages I am learning in my free time:
* **French**: Its rhythm is intriguing!
* **Dutch**: I like biking!
* **Portuguese**: My advisor is originally from Brazil, a country full of passion for life in my impression! 
* **Spanish**: It is the most used foreign language in America, especially in Florida where I live. 
* **Russian**: It sounds cool!
* **Korean**: I like some Korean TV shows and songs, and there are also a lot of similarities with Chinese.


## Reading ##
I like reading widely and casually while relaxing myself. Although I do not limit the content I read, realistic novels and financial management are what I read the most. There are so many great books, so reading greedily and casually is helpful most of the time unless the content is so important that we should slow down, think a bit, and take a note. 

Here are some books I would like to generously recommend (updated occasionally):
* [One Hundred Years of Solitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Hundred_Years_of_Solitude) by [Gabriel García Márquez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Garc%C3%ADa_M%C3%A1rquez)
* [Cold Mountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_Mountain_(novel)) by [Charles Frazier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Frazier)
* [The Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_(Plato)) by [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato)
* [The Social Animal](https://www.amazon.com/Social-Animal-Elliot-Aronson/dp/1464144184) by Elliot Aronson and Joshua Aronson
* [The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness](https://www.navalmanack.com/)

Some of my favorite writers include (updated occasionally):
* [Mo Yan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mo_Yan), Chinese novelist and short story writer, 2012 Nobel laureate in literature
* [Sanmao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanmao_(writer)), Chinese writer and translator
* [Ah Cheng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ah_Cheng), Chinese novelist, scriptwriter, and painter

* [Yasunari Kawabata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasunari_Kawabata), Japanese novelist and short story writer, 1968 Nobel laureate in literature


## Traveling ##
Reading keeps me in touch with the world, but the best way to know more about the world is to travel and experience by yourself. It could be expensive, but it is worth it if applicable. 
Here are some places I have visited and highly recommend:
* [Boston](https://www.meetboston.com/), MA, USA
* [Hongcun](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1002/), Anhui, China
* [Macau](https://www.macaotourism.gov.mo/en/), China
* [Ko Lanta](https://www.kolanta.net/), Thailand
* [Malacca](https://www.melaka-tourism.com/), Malaysia


## Music ##
Music is the universal language of mankind. I learned keyboard (thus a bit of piano as well) and [erhu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erhu) at a young age. I like classical, pop, and country music. Here are some of my favorite musicians:
* [Frédéric Chopin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Chopin), Polish composer and virtuoso pianist
* [Lang Lang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lang_Lang), Chinese pianist
* [Arthur Rubinstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Rubinstein), Polish-American pianist
* [Yao Beina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yao_Beina), Chinese singer
* [Eason Chan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eason_Chan), Chinese singer
* [Ed Sheeran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Sheeran), English singer-songwriter


## Sports ##
I like various physical sports, such as running, swimming, and playing basketball and table tennis. As for intellectual sports, I like playing [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)), one of the oldest and the most complicated board games. You have probably heard of it because of [AlphaGo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y) developed by Google Deepmind in recent years.
