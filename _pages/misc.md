Sharing and communication are important as we all need emotional support, consonance, and discussion to shape and become who we are. Here, I would like to share more about me.


# My Hobbies #
In my free time, I have a lot of hobbies as my brain food.  


## Language ##
I am a big fan of languages. Culture represents a group of human beings, while language represents a type of culture. Research shows that learning a foreign language is beneficial for mental activities. Getting the hang of a language can help us understand more about our fellow human beings rather than live in a world filled with misunderstandings and biases and explore more amazing things created by us, the little speck in the universe. Language is the key to the door of a new world. 

Here are the languages I can use confidently:
1. [**Mandarin Chinese**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandarin_Chinese): My native language. As one of the most complicated and oldest languages in the world, I am fascinated by the beauty of its rhythm and conciseness, especially the [poetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_poetry).
2. [**English**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language): I started learning English at 7 as it was a mandatory subject in school. I never found it difficult to learn, although I did not fully practice listening and speaking as the English classes in school focused much on reading and writing and English was not necessary in China. My English skills improved a lot after I moved to the United States where I intentionally force myself to use English every day, such as reading news articles, listening to podcasts, and talking to strangers whenever appropriate.
3. [**Cantonese Chinese**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantonese): I taught myself Cantonese when I was an undergrad due to my affection for pop songs and movies from Hong Kong. It is widely used in Guangdong (or Canton, where it gets its name) province, Guangxi province, Hong Kong SAR, Macau SAR, and many Chinese communities overseas. It is relatively closer to the pronunciations of ancient Chinese, so the grammar and characters are nearly the same as Mandarin, yet the pronunciations are quite different as there are six tones as well as some unique pronunciations  that do not exist in Mandarin.
4. [**Japanese**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language): It is probably the easiest foreign language for people from East Asia, especially China, as the grammar is very similar to Chinese, the writing system including Kanji, Hiragana, and Katakana is heavily based on Chinese characters, and the pronunciations of many vocabularies are similar to Chinese. Learning Japanese helps me better understand my native language from another perspective. 

I am interested in any language worldwide, and I would like to learn as many languages as possible. Here are the languages I am casually learning in my free time:
* **French**: Its rhythm is intriguing!
* **Dutch**: I like biking and windmills!
* **Portuguese**: My advisor is originally from Brazil, a country full of passion for life in my impression! 
* **Spanish**: It is the most used foreign language in America, especially in Florida where I live. 
* **Russian**: It sounds cool!
* **Korean**: I like some Korean TV shows and songs, and there are also a lot of similarities with Chinese.


## Reading ##
I like reading widely and casually while relaxing myself. Although I do not limit the content I read, magic realism and life management are what I read the most. There are numerous great books, so the breadth of reading is more important than depth unless the content is important enough to slow down, think, and take a note. 

Here are some books I would like to recommend (update occasionally):
* [One Hundred Years of Solitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Hundred_Years_of_Solitude) by [Gabriel García Márquez](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/1982/marquez/biographical/)
* [Cold Mountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_Mountain_(novel)) by [Charles Frazier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Frazier)
* [The Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_(Plato)) by [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato)
* [The Social Animal](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/203968) by [Elliot Aronson](https://aronson.socialpsychology.org/) and [Joshua Aronson](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/people/joshua-aronson)
* [The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness](https://www.navalmanack.com/) by [Eric Jorgenson](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4029970.Eric_Jorgenson)

## Traveling ##
Reading keeps me in touch with the world, but the best way to know more about the world is to travel, see, communicate, and feel by myself. It could be expensive, but it is worthwhile if applicable. 
Here are some places I have visited and highly recommend (update occasionally):
* [Boston](https://www.meetboston.com/), MA, United States
* [Hongcun](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1002/), Anhui, China
* [Macau](https://www.macaotourism.gov.mo/en/), China
* [Chiang Mai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiang_Mai), Thailand
* [Malacca](https://www.melaka-tourism.com/), Malaysia


## Music ##
Music is the universal language of mankind. I learned keyboard (thus a bit of piano as well) and [erhu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erhu) at a young age. I like classical, pop, indie, and country music. Only arts such as music and painting belong to human beings. Here are some of my favorite musicians (update occasionally):
* [Frédéric Chopin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Chopin), Polish composer and virtuoso pianist
* [Lang Lang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0tK9F_6g2w), Chinese pianist
* [Arthur Rubinstein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttLRonyyMak), Polish-American pianist
* [Yao Beina](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8MjP2t1zXw), Chinese singer
* [Eason Chan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cSRZbW-0Nc), Chinese singer
* [Sodagreen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuEja-aL1Uk), Taiwanese indie band
* [Taylor Swift](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYa1eI1hpDE), American singer-songwriter


## Sports ##
I like various physical sports, such as running, swimming, and playing basketball and table tennis. As for intellectual sports, I like playing [Go](https://www.britannica.com/topic/go-game), one of the oldest and the most complicated board games. You have probably heard of it because of [AlphaGo](https://www.deepmind.com/research/highlighted-research/alphago) developed by Google DeepMind in recent years.  



# My Philosophy #
My views are heavily influenced by [Taoism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoism), [Chinese Buddism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Buddhism), and [Confusianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucianism). Although I have no religious belief as I regard religion as another way to explain and appreciate the world, I am interested in the core ideas of any religion and absorb some of them into my own worldview.

We can neither change the past nor accurately predict the future, and nothing can be done without external conditions. Working hard can satisfy one of the conditions for success, but if the results are still not what we expect, let it go. Even if I were able to exactly tell what would happen, such as who we would meet, when we would get a new job, and how much money we would make, many teeny-tiny things would not bring me surprise and happiness anymore. 

We came to the earth, met each other, and created some wonderful memories. Eventually, we will die, the earth will die, and everything will vanish, just like we have never existed. Everything is so unpredictable, thus every second is cherishable, and even some undesirable experiences also help us become better. When I get old and look back on my whole life, what makes me regret would not be what I did but what I never tried. 

In short, life is unpredictable and full of randomness, so I appreciate every second. The only meaning of my life is to experience. Live in the moment.

Just like what unpredictability means, my thoughts will also develop as my life goes on. I like talking to different people, so we can better understand each other and absorb new ideas to test our existing ideological framework. There are no right or wrong thoughts to me as long as they are ethical, even though right and wrong must exist regarding justice. That is, the robustness of ideology is shades of grey within the range of ethics covered by justice. 

Here are some related ideas that shaped my views:
* [The butterfly dream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuangzi_(book)#%22The_Butterfly_Dream%22), a metaphor in [Zhuangzi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuangzi_(book)) by [Zhuang Zhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuang_Zhou)
* [Special relative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity) and [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity) by [Albert Einstein](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1921/einstein/biographical/)
* [The origin of the universe](https://www.hawking.org.uk/in-words/lectures/the-origin-of-the-universe) by [Stephen Hawking](https://www.hawking.org.uk/biography)
* [Karma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma)
* [Memento Mori](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6181962/), documentary
