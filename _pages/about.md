**About**

Welcome! I am a PhD student in the [Florida Institute for Cybersecurity Research](https://fics.institute.ufl.edu/) of [University of Florida](https://www.ufl.edu/). My current research direction is human-centered computing, which focuses on the human factors in computer security issues, such as phishing, disinformation and malware, and involves multiple disciplines, including computer science, social engineering, psychology and law. I enjoy stepping out of comfort zone to explore the unknown. 

I am currently seeking internships as a researcher or software engineer for the next year. I'd appreciate it if you'd like to reach out and chat about any opportunities available.
