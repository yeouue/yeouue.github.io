**About**

Welcome! I am a PhD student in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ufl.edu/) at [University of Florida](https://www.ufl.edu/) and a research assistant at [Florida Institute for Cybersecurity (FICS) Research](https://fics.institute.ufl.edu/) under the supervision of [Dr. Daniela Seabra Oliveira](https://danielaseabraoliveira.com/). My current research interests focus on human-centered computing and social engineering involving multiple disciplines, such as computer science, communications, psychology, and law, but with a main focus on technologies to resolve security-related issues, such as phishing, disinformation, and malware, based on a better understanding of human factors. I enjoy stepping out of my comfort zone to explore the unknown. 

I am seeking internships as a researcher or software engineer for Summer 2024. If you know of any opportunities, you are more than welcome to contact me!
