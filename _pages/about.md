**About**

Welcome! I am a Ph.D. student in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ufl.edu/) at the [University of Florida](https://www.ufl.edu/) and a research assistant at [Florida Institute for Cybersecurity (FICS) Research](https://fics.institute.ufl.edu/) previously under [Dr. Daniela Seabra Oliveira](https://danielaseabraoliveira.com/). My current research interests lie in usable security and social engineering, especially malicious activities online, such as misinformation, phishing, toxic comments, gender bias, and malware (stalkerware and ransomware). My research aims to understand the role human factors play under the hood and develop technical solutions to protect vulnerable users, such as children, teenagers, and elders, from getting harmed online. It involves interdisciplinary knowledge, including computer science and engineering, mass communication, psychology, law, and politics, but mainly focuses on technology. I enjoy stepping out of my comfort zone to explore the unknown.

I am seeking internship opportunities as a Ph.D. researcher or software engineer in Summer 2024. If you know of any opportunities and would like to let me know, you are welcome to contact me via email or LinkedIn!
