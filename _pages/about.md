**About**

Welcome! I am a PhD student in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ufl.edu/) at [University of Florida](https://www.ufl.edu/) and a research assistant at [Florida Institute for Cybersecurity Research](https://fics.institute.ufl.edu/). My current research interest focuses on human-centered computing and social engineering for a better understanding of human factors in computer security issues, such as phishing, disinformation, and malware. It involves multiple disciplines, such as computer science, communications, psychology, and law, but focuses more on technologies to resolve security-related issues. I enjoy stepping out of my comfort zone to explore the unknown. 

I am seeking internships as a researcher or software engineer for Summer 2024. If you know of any opportunities, you are more than welcome to contact me!
