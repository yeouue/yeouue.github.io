Iâ€™m a PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Florida. My current research interests are focused on the human factors in computer security issues, such as phishing, disinformation and malware, which involve the knowledge in multiple disciplines, including computer science, social engineering, psychology and law.
